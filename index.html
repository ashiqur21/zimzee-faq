                <p>It is a designation from the Property Investment Professionals of Australia (PIPA). It signifies
                    expertise in
                    property investment advice, ensuring clients receive specialised guidance tailored to their

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>Long answer short: the one you can stick to that supports your long term goals. Tactics such as debt
                    recycling, negative/positive gearing, manufacturing equity can all yield great results. The best
                    thing to do
                    is book a free strategy session and get some clarity.

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>Our income is broken down into two main components. A one-time onboarding fee for new clients of $399
                    + GST
                    when the loan application process is started. And commissions paid by the bank. We receive zero
                    payments from
                    any partners we connect you with. Your initial strategy session is free of charge and obligation
                    free. </p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>To put it simply, so we can spend more time with clients who are committed and less time with those
                    who are
                    not a good fit. We don’t profit from the fee, as it is reinvested into our 5 Steps To Client
                    Success. </p>

            <label class="accordion-label" for="check8"> Shouldn’t I just apply directly?</label>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>There’s no broker bias here. Believe it or not, there is times where it IS better to apply direct. I
                    have
                    sent potential clients directly to lenders when it is in there best interest. But you should always
                    have a
                    chat with a trusted broker first. </p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>
                    Of course! Most people looking to buy their place of residence either won't stay there forever or
                    are looking
                    to build equity in it to use at a later date. Having someone to work by your side to identify any
                    risks and
                    future proof your strategy can only be a good thing as one mistake in the set up can set you back
                    significantly. </p>

                    <li>Click "Add to Chrome”. You might see a message asking you, if you're sure. </li>
                    <li>Click "Add extension."</li>
                    <li>After adding the extension, you will see the Zimzee icon at the top of Chrome. *If you don't
                        see it, click on the puzzle piece icon at the top.
                    </li>
                    <li>5. Find the Zimzee extension in the list that pops up and click on the little pin so it stays on
                        top of Chrome where you can always see it.

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>Long answer short: the one you can stick to that supports your long term goals. Tactics such as debt
                    recycling, negative/positive gearing, manufacturing equity can all yield great results. The best
                    thing to do
                    is book a free strategy session and get some clarity.

                <p>Our income is broken down into two main components. A one-time onboarding fee for new clients of $399

                    when the loan application process is started. And commissions paid by the bank. We receive zero
                    payments from
                    any partners we connect you with. Your initial strategy session is free of charge and obligation

                <p>To put it simply, so we can spend more time with clients who are committed and less time with those
                    who are
                    not a good fit. We don’t profit from the fee, as it is reinvested into our 5 Steps To Client

                <p>There’s no broker bias here. Believe it or not, there is times where it IS better to apply direct. I
                    have
                    sent potential clients directly to lenders when it is in there best interest. But you should always
                    have a
